# Alliance of OpenUSD (AOUSD) Landscape

![Landscape Logo](https://landscape.aousd.org/images/logo-horizontal-color.svg)

This landscape is intended as a map to explore the Alliance of OpenUSD (AOUSD) member companies. It is modeled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) and based on the same open-source code.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [AOUSD landscape](https://landscape.aosud.org). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## Local Build and Install

You can build the landscape locally on your machine using the [landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) tool. Once [installed](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can use the commands below to build the landscape and serve it locally.

```shell
landscape2 build --data-file landscape.yml --settings-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/landscape2-sites/refs/heads/main/aousd/settings.yml --logos-path hosted_logos --output-dir build
landscape2 serve --landscape-dir build
```
